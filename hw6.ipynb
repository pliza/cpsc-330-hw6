    "In the previous exercise, you may have noticed that clustering results were suboptimal. While the bag-of-words (BoW) representation is useful, it has significant limitations. It does not capture word order or context effectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To improve text representation, we can use pre-trained models, similar to those used for image data, to extract richer, context-aware embeddings through transfer learning. In this lab, we will use the **pre-trained model** `'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'`, available via the [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/index.html) package.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This deep learning model generates **dense, fixed-length vector representations** of sentences, capturing **semantic meaning and contextual information**. These representations are particularly effective for **clustering and semantic similarity tasks**. If you're interested in exploring more **pre-trained models**, refer to the [full list here](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html). We will explore these representations further in **DSCI 575**.  \n",

    "The way the documents are represented with embeddings has a big impact on clustering because it defines what counts as similar, so if the embeddings are not very clear, the clusters can be messy. Kmeans could not capture similarities in the way which I wanted. DBSCAN was tricky to use at first since most points ended up as noise or in one big cluster until I tuned eps and min_samples. Hierarchical clustering gave a nice dendrogram and let me control the number of clusters with fcluster, making it very easy. I think that the clusters made sense only when the embeddings captured meaningful differences between the documents. I think that all 3 algorithms take into account the shape of the data but since they use different methods to cluster the data, they give varying quality of results. THe clustering results do match with my intuition and reflect what I had anwered in question 1.1 too for each method."

This will also involve making some attempts to pick reasonable hyperparameter values for each clustering method based on the quality of the resulting clusters. For example, for KMeans, you need to specify the number of clusters in advance, which is often challenging on real-world datasets. For DBSCAN, you need to pick appropriate `eps` and `min_samples`. For hierarchical clustering, you need to pick a suitable linkage criterion, distance metric, and prune the tree so that it's possible to visualize and interpret it. \n",
